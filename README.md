# Siah-Kondak-Supercollider
Realtime I/O for the Improvisor project

Tartini and other Dependencies found [here](https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins)

## Goals:

- Build settings gui with correct file i/o for saving settings

- turn off MIDI playback in impro-visor

- build regression tests with audio files -- expected output and scripts for comparing

- Improve reaction time (?!?!)
  	  -- OSC Snapshots tinker with rate
	  -- Look into 3rd party tools for freqency and onset detection
